# What New York City Traffic can Teach Us About Urban Life.

New York City us a living, breathing organism powered not just by people but the movement of cars, buses, trucks, and taxis weaving through its arteries. This project sets out to explore how this motion plays out across time and space using nine years of traffic volume data from the NYC Department of Transportation.

What I found out paints a story not only of the urban city, but a story of life and resilience.

# How Has NYC Traffic Changed Over Time ?

I started with a basic question: Is traffic increasing or decreasing over the years. The data covers from 2012 to 2021, and while it steadily rose until 2016, there is a sharp dip in 2020 - 2021. Not suprisingly, thos were the COVID years when lockdown made burstling cities very quiet. In 2021, traffic volumes were far below 2016 peaks.

# Weekdays vs Weekends: Is Sunday the New Stay-at-Home Day?

By breaking down average traffic volume by day of the week, a pattern emerges.

Sunday is the quitest day on NYC streets. It is significantly lower than weekdays. Traffic builds slowly through Monday to Friday, peaking midweek. Saturday holds its own, likely due to shopping, errands, and leisure travel. But Sunday? It's New York's deep breath.

# Hourly Pulse: When Does NYC Breathe Fastest?

Using hourly data, we see a city waking up in unison. On weekdays, 8 AM and 5 PM are unmistakable spikes - the classic rush hours.

Weekends tell a different story. The city rises later. Peaks come around 3 PM, likely duue to outings, errands or social plans. The calm before the Saturday night storm?

# The Busiest Roads in NYC

If NYC's streets are veins, then the Long Island Expressway is it Aorta. It consistently records the highest traffic volume. Staten Island Expressway isn't far behind. These roads aren't just busy, they are essential.

The average traffic here dwarfs other segments, raising questions about maintenance, congestion pricing, and alternate routes.

# Play With the Data: Build Your Own Traffic Story.

I built an interactive tool so you can filter traffic by day of week and hour — try it for yourself.

Pick a Tuesday morning. Then compare it to a Sunday afternoon. Notice the shape of the curves. You can begin to anticipate the city’s flow — almost like reading a pulse chart.

What would you do with this information? Leave earlier? Take another route? Choose a different delivery time?

# What Suprised Me

- Sundays are sacred. The volume dip
- COVID's shadow on busy roads

- Few roads carry the bulk: If you reduce congestion on 5-6 major expressways, you impact most of NYC.

# Why It Matters

Understanding traffic isn’t just about commuting — it’s about how we live in a city. These patterns reveal:

When we rest

Where we cluster

How we adapt in crisis

And where our infrastructure strains

Imagine urban planners using this to shape better bus routes. Or delivery companies optimizing around peak hours. Or you — choosing when to leave your apartment based on actual, data-driven patterns.
